--Face Recognition using Anaconda Navigator--
****Important Note:***
You must install Anaconda Navigator to use this code.

***Setup Steps:*****
Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the code in the "FaceRecognition.ipynb" file.

1.Open Anaconda Prompt.

2.Navigate to a relevant path where you want to set up the environment.

3.Execute the following commands line by line

3.1 "python -m venv IM5 " # (IM5 is the kernel name; you can use any name you prefer)

3.2 ".\IM5\Scripts\activate"

3.3 "pip install ipykernel"

3.4 "python -m ipykernel install --name=IM5"

These commands will create and activate a virtual environment named "IM5" and install the necessary kernel for running the code.

Your kernel has been successfully created.

Add recognition image and other test  images to the relevant kernel path.

Using Jupyter Notebook, create a new file.

Select the kernel you created ("IM5").

Execute the code inside the "FaceRecognition.ipynb" file line by line.
